# IIS Session Count Montior
##  Monitoring page shows number of active sessions on each listed IIS server
Uses javascript module to remotely query IIS active session count
Handy to ensure load balancing distribution is even
If IIS server is down, server is marked is red 0; same with IIS timeout so general IIS health is reflected
